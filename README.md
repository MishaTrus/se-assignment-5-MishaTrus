![Terminal](<Screenshot (64).png>)

Using the Integrated Terminal:
Once the terminal is open:
- Navigation: You can navigate to your project directory or any other directory using standard commands (cd for example).
- Running Commands: Execute commands directly within the terminal. For instance, you can run build scripts (npm run build), start servers (node server.js), or run Git commands (git status, git pull, etc.).
- Multiple Instances: You can have multiple terminal instances open simultaneously by clicking the plus sign (+) in the terminal tab or using the Split Terminal option.
- Customization: The integrated terminal supports customization options such as changing the default shell (e.g., PowerShell, Command Prompt, Bash), setting specific shell profiles, and adjusting font sizes.

Advantages of Using the Integrated Terminal:

- Contextual Integration: The terminal is integrated directly into the VS Code environment, allowing for seamless interaction between editing and terminal tasks without switching between different applications.
- Productivity: Perform common development tasks such as running scripts, executing commands, and managing version control operations without leaving the editor.
- Workflow Efficiency: Easily navigate between files and execute commands in the same window, speeding up workflow and reducing context switching.
- Workspace State: The terminal operates within the context of your current workspace, making it easier to manage dependencies and execute commands relevant to your project.
- Debugging Support: Integrate debugging output with your terminal commands, providing a comprehensive view of both code execution and system interactions.

Comparison with External Terminals:

- Convenience: Avoids the need to switch between different applications or windows, keeping all development tasks consolidated within VS Code.
- Integration: Seamlessly integrates with VS Code’s workspace and editor features, enhancing overall development efficiency.
- Customization: Offers flexibility in configuring shell preferences and terminal appearance directly within the VS Code settings.

- Use the `Restore Default Settings` option or `Reset` button next to settings to revert changes if needed.


9. Debugging in VS Code:
   - Outline the steps to set up and start debugging a simple program in VS Code. What are some key debugging features available in VS Code?

Setting Up and Starting Debugging:

Open Your Project:
- Launch VS Code and open the folder containing your project or the specific file you want to debug.

Create a Debug Configuration:
- Click on the `Run` icon in the Activity Bar on the side (or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
- Click on `create a launch.json file` and select the runtime environment for your project (e.g., Node.js, Python, etc.).
- VS Code will generate a `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder with default configurations.

Set Breakpoints:
- Navigate to the file you want to debug.
- Click in the gutter next to the line number where you want to set a breakpoint (or use `F9` shortcut).
- Breakpoints pause program execution at specific points, allowing you to inspect variables and step through code.

Start Debugging:
- Press `F5` or click on the green `Start Debugging` button in the Run view to begin debugging.
- If prompted, select the debug configuration you created earlier.

Debugging Controls:
- Once debugging starts, use the following controls in the Debug view (or via keyboard shortcuts):
- Step Over: `F10` - Step over the current line of code.
- Step Into: `F11` - Step into the function call.
- Step Out: `Shift+F11` - Step out of the current function.
- Continue: `F5` - Resume execution until the next breakpoint.
- Stop: `Shift+F5` - Stop debugging session.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code:

Variable Inspection:
- View and monitor the values of variables and expressions in real-time as you step through your code.

Call Stack:
- Navigate through the call stack to understand the sequence of function calls leading to the current breakpoint.

Watch Expressions:
- Add expressions to watch them during debugging sessions, providing immediate feedback on their values.

Conditional Breakpoints:
- Set breakpoints that only trigger when certain conditions are met, enhancing control over when debugging pauses.

Debug Console:
- Execute commands and interact with your application in real-time through the integrated debug console.

Debugging Multiple Threads:
- Debug applications with multi-threaded or asynchronous operations, tracking each thread's execution independently.

Integrated Terminal Integration:
- Interact with debugging commands and outputs directly within the integrated terminal of VS Code.


10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

Commit Changes:
- Enter a commit message in the textbox provided at the top of the Source Control view.
- Press `Ctrl+Enter` or click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.

Push Changes to GitHub:

- Link GitHub Repository:
- If not already linked, click on the `Publish to GitHub` link that appears after committing changes, or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the Command Palette and search for "GitHub: Set Personal Access Token" to authorize your GitHub account.

Push Commits:
- After committing changes locally, click on the `...` (More Actions) button in the Source Control view.
- Select `Push` to push your commits to the remote repository on GitHub

Managing Branches and Pull Requests:

Create and Switch Branches:
- Use the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type "Git: Create Branch" to create a new branch.
- Use "Git: Checkout to..." to switch between branches.

Pull Requests:
